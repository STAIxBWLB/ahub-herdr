Never edit the JSON to suit this repository. A change belongs to agent-hub; a new contract version (`companion-cli-v2.json`) arrives here by `hub_task_handoff`.

## Known gap in v1

The mod runs `ahub --project <id> ui` and `ahub --project <id> console` (a registration id, from `projects --json`). v1 lists `ui` and `--project <root> console` only. `test/companion-cli-contract.test.ts` records these two forms as an expected gap and fails when v1 lists them, so the gap is removed from the test then. It was reported to agent-hub (#1387, T0) in the T2 bring-up.
